Alright — here’s a **consolidated, investor-grade concept document** that pulls together **technical architecture, GTM strategy, commercial model, and the curated invite growth mechanism** we’ve discussed.

---

## **Project Codename:** HumanLink

*The human-verified, privacy-first, small-world social network.*

---

## **1. Vision**

HumanLink is a decentralized, privacy-first social platform where:

* **Every user is a verified human** (no bots, no fake profiles).
* Social circles are intentionally small: max **150 connections** per user (Dunbar’s number).
* No ads, no algorithmic feeds, no data harvesting — just pure, chronological sharing.
* Access is **invite-only**, ensuring trust and authenticity from the start.
* The architecture is designed for **low infrastructure costs** and massive horizontal scalability.

---

## **2. Technical Approach**

### **2.1 Architecture**

* **Hybrid decentralized model:**

  * Each user’s device holds their data and posts locally.
  * **Lightweight relay servers** handle:

    * Encrypted message passing
    * Offline delivery
    * Device sync (e.g., phone ↔ web)
  * No central “brain” that reorders feeds or analyzes content.

* **Small-world topology:**

  * Users are connected in overlapping groups (max 150 connections each).
  * No global “everyone” feed — just your circles.
  * Overlap enables organic growth but prevents exponential spam.

* **End-to-end encryption:**

  * Data belongs to the originator.
  * Relay nodes store only encrypted payloads.

* **Device sync model:**

  * QR-code or token-based linking between a user’s devices.
  * Relay server holds encrypted state for temporary sync.

---

### **2.2 Scalability**

* Minimal infra costs:

  * At 1M active users, \~\$5K/month estimated infra vs \~\$500K/month for a centralized feed-based network.
* Horizontal scaling:

  * More relay nodes can be added regionally with almost linear cost.
* Predictable growth due to invite-only onboarding.

---

## **3. Go-to-Market (GTM) Approach**

### **3.1 Growth model: Curated trust-chain invitations**

* **Invite-only access** — new users must be invited by an existing member.
* Each user gets **limited invites** (e.g., 3–5/year).
* Inviter reputation affects future invite ability.
* Optional **physical verification** (NFC or QR) for extra trust.

### **3.2 Target audiences (early focus)**

* Privacy-conscious professionals
* Grassroots communities
* Creators with tight-knit fanbases
* Families and local groups

### **3.3 Launch sequence**

1. **Closed alpha** — 500–1,000 hand-picked users in overlapping groups.
2. **Controlled beta** — invite system opened, capped growth rate.
3. **Organic expansion** — invite tree analysis ensures trust remains high.
4. **Premium features** introduced once base community is stable.

## **4. Commercial Model**

**Tiered subscription model (weekly billing):**

| Tier        | Weekly Price | Max Connections | Features                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base**    | \$0.99       | 50              | Chronological feed, encrypted messaging, invite credits               |
| **Premium** | \$1.79       | 150             | Full Dunbar limit, priority relay routing, device sync, extra invites |

**Projected annual ARPU:**

* Base tier: \~\$51.48/year
* Premium tier: \~\$93.08/year

If 60% of users take Premium and we reach:

* **100K users:** \~\$7.3M ARR
* **1M users:** \~\$73M ARR

---

## **5. TAM / Market Opportunity**

* **Global social media users (2025):** \~5.2B
* **Privacy-conscious segment (\~15%):** \~780M
* **Likely early-adopter market (\~5%):** \~260M
* At \~\$70/year ARPU, **conservative TAM:** \~\$15B/year
* Unique economics: growth costs are minimal vs centralized models.

---

## **6. Investor Pitch Angles**

1. **Low-cost scaling:** Serve 1M users at a fraction of Big Tech’s infra bill.
2. **Network health by design:** Invite-only, small circles, no bots.
3. **High retention:** Communities are deeply personal and curated.
4. **Defensible market:** Competes on *trust*, not on algorithm speed or ad reach.
5. **Revenue-first from day one:** No ad dependency.

---

## **7. Next Steps**

* Build MVP with core:

  * Device-local storage
  * Encrypted relay messaging
  * Invite system
  * Chronological feed
* Launch alpha to 500–1,000 seed users.
* Begin trust-chain growth tracking and refine invite mechanics.

* **A budget model spreadsheet** showing infra cost vs revenue over 5 years
* **A visual technical diagram** for the investor deck
* **A TAM–SAM–SOM pyramid** to drive the opportunity home visually.
